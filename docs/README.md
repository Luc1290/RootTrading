- **Enhanced OBV Validation**: Linear regression trend analysis

### Coordinator Service (Trust-Based Architecture)
Manages the complete trade lifecycle from signal to execution with enhanced trust model.

**Responsibilities:**
- Trade cycle creation and management
- Risk management rule enforcement
- Position sizing calculation
- Trade state coordination
- **Enhanced Trust Model**: Trusts signal aggregator decisions (no re-validation)
- **Regime-Aware Processing**: Adapts to market conditions

### Trader Service

- Balance synchronization with Binance

## üîß Configuration

### Trading Pairs
Configure trading pairs in the gateway service configuration:
```python
# Services/gateway/src/config.py
SYMBOLS = ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "BNBUSDT"]
```

### Risk Management
Adjust risk parameters in the coordinator service:
```python
# Services/coordinator/src/config.py
MAX_POSITION_SIZE = 0.02  # 2% of portfolio per position
MAX_CONCURRENT_TRADES = 5
STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE = 0.02  # 2% stop loss
```

### Technical Indicators
Configure analysis strategies in the analyzer service:
```python
# Services/analyzer/strategies/
# Add custom strategy files here
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Debug Tools
The project includes various debug utilities in the `Debug/` directory:

- `active_cycles_analysis.py` - Monitor active trading cycles
- `strategy_analysis.py` - Analyze strategy performance
- `db_analysis.py` - Database health checks
- `hourly_price_analysis.py` - Price movement analysis

### Logging
Each service logs to stdout/stderr. View logs using:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Type checking
mypy .

# Linting
ruff check .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Adding New Strategies
1. Create a new strategy file in `Services/analyzer/strategies/`
