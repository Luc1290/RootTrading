# RootTrading - Cryptocurrency Trading System

A microservices-based cryptocurrency trading system for Binance exchange, featuring real-time market analysis, signal generation, and automated trading execution.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

RootTrading is built using a distributed microservices architecture with the following core components:

### Core Services

- **Gateway Service** - Market data ingestion from Binance WebSocket streams
- **Analyzer Service** - Technical analysis and indicator calculation
- **Signal Aggregator** - Signal aggregation and Bayesian weight optimization
- **Coordinator Service** - Trade orchestration and lifecycle management
- **Trader Service** - Order execution and position management
- **Portfolio Service** - Portfolio tracking and performance monitoring
- **Dispatcher Service** - Message routing and service communication

### Infrastructure Components

- **PostgreSQL** - Primary data storage for trades, signals, and market data
- **Redis** - Real-time data caching and pub/sub messaging
- **Kafka** - Event streaming for service communication
- **Docker Compose** - Container orchestration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Binance API credentials

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

## üîß Configuration

### Trading Pairs
Configure trading pairs in the gateway service configuration:
```python
# Services/gateway/src/config.py
SYMBOLS = ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "BNBUSDT"]
```

### Risk Management
Adjust risk parameters in the coordinator service:
```python
# Services/coordinator/src/config.py
MAX_POSITION_SIZE = 0.02  # 2% of portfolio per position
MAX_CONCURRENT_TRADES = 5
STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE = 0.02  # 2% stop loss
```

### Technical Indicators
Configure analysis strategies in the analyzer service:
```python
# Services/analyzer/strategies/
# Add custom strategy files here
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Debug Tools
The project includes various debug utilities in the `Debug/` directory:

- `active_cycles_analysis.py` - Monitor active trading cycles
- `strategy_analysis.py` - Analyze strategy performance
- `db_analysis.py` - Database health checks
- `hourly_price_analysis.py` - Price movement analysis

### Logging
Each service logs to stdout/stderr. View logs using:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Type checking
mypy .

# Linting
ruff check .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Adding New Strategies
1. Create a new strategy file in `Services/analyzer/strategies/`
2. Implement the `BaseStrategy` interface
3. Register the strategy in `strategy_loader.py`

## üö® Important Notes

- **API Keys Security**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Risk Management**: Always test strategies with small amounts first
- **Market Conditions**: System performance varies with market volatility
- **Maintenance**: Regular database maintenance recommended for optimal performance
